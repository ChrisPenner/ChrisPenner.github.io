For those who haven't heard of it, postman is a tool for interacting with and
exploring API's. Effectively it's a pretty UI on top of curl; but it makes a
big difference when figuring out how exactly to structure an API call, or
testing what the response from an api might look like.

Let's get started, first go ahead and [GET POSTMAN](https://www.getpostman.com/);

Here's roughly what you'll see when you start it up:

![Overview](/images/postman/overview.png)

# Requests

Let's walk through the Request interface (in order of importance, stop when you get bored)

![Requests](/images/postman/request.png)

1.  URL
    -   This bit's pretty important, put a URL in here, click the SEND button.
        Now you can use Postman.
2.  HTTP VERB
    -   Here you can choose what type of request to make; GET, POST, PATCH,
        DELETE, etc.
    -   This choice effects which other options are available; for instance you
        can't set a BODY on a GET request.
3.  SEND
    -   Hit this button to make the magic happen and actually send off your
        request.
4.  Params
    -   This gives you a nice interface for editing GET parameters as keys and
        values. Don't get it confused with the idea of sending keys and values
        with a POST request.
5.  Body
    -   Only available on non-GET requests
    -   Can choose your body type and it'll encode it for you
    -   Use 'raw' and use the dropdown on the right to set the content-type to
        JSON for most APIs
    -   Use form-data if you're simulating an old-school form submission or
        some older-style APIs
6.  Headers
    -   Set any HTTP headers you need here;
    -   Typically just used for Authentication headers; You can put a jwt auth
        header in here for instance.
7.  Authorization
    -   Sometimes helpful for interacting with 3rd party APIs
    -   Choosing Basic Auth will encode a username and password into the
        request for you.


# Responses

![Responses](/images/postman/response.png)

Cool stuff; we can set up our request. Now let's say we hit the big blue SEND button and we have a response!

1.  Body
    -   We're probably most interested in the Body of the response
2.  Headers
    -   If you want to check the headers of the response this's where you'll
        find'em
3.  Response Type
    -   Postman can pretty print the response if we tell it to; set this to
        JSON and it'll nicely format the response for you.
4.  Utilities
    -   First one is "Copy to Clipboard"; handy for sharing with your helpful
        co-workers
    -   Second opens a search in the response
    -   Third let's you save it for later
5.  Stats
    -   Here we can see Response Time, Status Code and response size.


So that's pretty much it for making simple requests, but I've missed a few of the more useful things about postman; you
can save collections of requests to share with people; and also save lists of environment variables which can be
interpolated into requests.

## History 

![History](/images/postman/history.png)

You can see your request history via the tab at the top and load up any past
requests, which is handy if you've edited a request and want to get back to a
previous version of it; or you're like me and you can't remember anything that
happened more than 15 minutes ago.

## Collections

 ![Collections](/images/postman/collections.png)

This panel on the left will probably have nothing in it when you start. At any
time you can hit the 'save' button to the right of the URL bar to save a
request for later.

I keep collections of requests around when I'm testing, and I often make
collections to share with my team.

# Environments

![Environments](/images/postman/environments.png)

Here we can set a context to execute our requests in. An environment can
contain a set of key-value settings which we can use anywhere in our request.
This is great if you're testing api's as different users, or if you have to
test the same calls against several different hosts.

If you set up some environment variables you can interpolate them into your
requests using double curly braces. For example you might make a request to
`example.com/my-endpoint?apiKey={{apiKey}}&apiUser={{apiUser}}`, now if you
have postman environments set up for each user and key you can switch between
them easily. You can use `{{}}` anywhere it would make sense; e.g.Â urls,
params, POST bodies, etc.

# Need a session with the site? Use Interceptor

Interceptor is one of Postman's cooler features; it allows the Postman app to route
the requests through your chrome instance; this means they'll include any
cookies (and therefore sessions) you have in chrome. 

![Interceptor](/images/postman/interceptor.png)

NOTE! Interceptor is currently only available in the chrome Postman plugin, NOT
the desktop app; so if you don't see this icon, you're probably using the
desktop app and will need to switch over to [Postman chrome
app](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop)
to use it. You'll also need to install the [Postman Interceptor Chrome
Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-interceptor/aicmkgpgakddgnaphhhpliifpcfhicfo?hl=en).

Now if we click to enable the chrome interceptor plugin, all our requests will
pick up any cookies that exist in our chrome session! Handy! You can also flip
a switch in the browser extension and have it track requests happening in your
browser through Postman's history.

# Importing/Exporting

Postman has the ability to import curl requests using the "import" button on
the top left, but you can also export code for each request in a language of
your choice using the "code" button on the right. You can export as Python,
HTTP, curl, Go, Java, Node, etc.

That's pretty much it for Postman. Tip your _*servers*_, I'm here all week.
