This marks the beginning of a new feature, **Worth a Read**, which will contain a quick
and easy list of blog posts and articles that I've found interesting recently.
They may have to do with programming, design, lifestyle, cool products, or
anything else I've been reading. Might be themed, might not! Hope you enjoy it!

This week's list contains a variety of topics from different disciplines,
hopefully you'll find something interesting! Follow me on twitter

posts!
