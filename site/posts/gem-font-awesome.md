Not all open-source projects are software or code! Here's a project that has
definitely helped me out as I build various websites.

Their site states their project best: "Font Awesome gives you scalable vector
icons that can instantly be customized â€” size, color, drop shadow, and anything
that can be done with the power of CSS." This has many advantages over using
images for these icons. Firstly they can be included with other text in-line
without any trouble, no need to worry about margins/padding etc. The icons
will also scale with their font size according to the CSS. Lastly (this was a
game-changer for me) you can change the colour of the icons in any way you can
change text-colour. This makes mouse-over responsive buttons a cinch and also
means you don't need to recolor every icon on the site when you change your
colour-scheme.

All of these perks are on top of the fact that you don't need to hire an artist
to create these icons in the first place, they've got quite a comprehensive
collection already.

TLDR:

* Every type of icon you could need available as one easy font.
* Icons scale, change color, and react like text.
* Free!

Go ahead and check out the icons and maybe even add one of your own here:
