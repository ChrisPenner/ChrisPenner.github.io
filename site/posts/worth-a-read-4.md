Okay! This time we're reading about cool and useful Unix tools. We've got some
wargames to start us off, a fun way to learn Unix better through a series of
challenges. Next is a great series of articles regarding using Unix as a
development environment, then an overview of awk and tmux, some of the most
useful Unix tools that I use. Finally a list of some other cool tools you may
want to check out. I hope you find that it's worth a read!
