Speaking of open-source gems, it's tough to make it too far into this topic
without mentioning Git. If you've been at all involved in the open source
community recently then you're certainly familiar with it already. If not, then
learning Git is a great place to start your journey into open-source tech.

Git is a distributed version control system that has taken the
open-source world by storm. In contrast with most previous version
control systems, everyone working on a project has access to their
own copy of the source files. They can change them as they like, and
then may merge their changes back into the main repository when their
change is complete. This method allows hundreds of people to work on the
same project at a time, and git's focus on branching and merging makes
it painless to add experimental features. In addition to it's unique
design, git is also blazing fast in comparison with it's competition.

Git has seamless integration with Github, a website dedicated to hosting
open-source software that is managed with git. At any rate, I can yammer
on about it, or you can just go check it out and start using it.

TLDR:

* Git's *Distributed* nature allows hundreds of people to work on a project
    at the same time.
* Git is fast and is built around the ideals of quick branching and merging
* Git's integration with Github (for hosting) make it a great choice for hosting
    open-source projects.

If you want to check out the source, of course you can find it on
[Github](https://github.com/git/git), read the documentation to learn how to
contribute.
