description: When did schooling become more important than skill? Should we really be discriminating against people based on the school they went to?

I must prefix this discussion with the disclaimer that I haven't done any
studies nor performed official research, however I have a general feeling, it's
an atmosphere, that I've noticed. And often a shared feeling like this, or a
bias perpetuated in the media is enough to make a difference in the way we
think about things.

In the TV Series **Suits** (which I've been watching lately) the main law firm
has a strict policy wherein they hire exclusively from Harvard. "Of course!"
many people say... "Harvard is the best!", but are they really? Is everyone who
graduates from Harvard just inherently better than those girls and guys who get
their community college degrees or go to a local state University in Mississippi
somewhere?

> When did schooling become more important than skill?

Certainly these schools have obtained their reputations as a result of careful
planning, good professors, and a rigorous and uncompromising gauntlet of
education. This means that to make it through one of these schools you must be
rather clever, and that graduating there DOES mean something, but I'm not
convinced that it means enough to justify this educational prejudice that I've
seen.

These Ivy League schools require amazing marks, community involvement, and
LOTS of money for students to attend. If a student is missing one or more of
these things, they will miss out on the opportunity to attend one of these
schools, and as a result will miss many further opportunities that they may
have otherwise been been qualified for. Many companies will pass over State
University degrees for someone from Yale without even a second thought. When
did schooling become more important than skill? Someone who made a few poor
choices in high school and didn't find their passions until a few years into
college is systematically disadvantaged from that point on. It doesn't have to
be this way!

I'm Canadian, and as far as I can tell, this problem hasn't gained much
traction here. I can get just as far with a degree from University of
Saskatchewan as I can with one from University of Toronto. In fact, I'd never
even heard of University of Toronto until now when I needed to look it up to
confirm that it actually exists. Companies here tend to use degrees as a baseline
requirement for a job, but not as a strong indicator of skill or personal
ability. This is good, it gives equal opportunity to all qualified applicants
and makes the job hunt about finding the person most qualified, not the one
with the most family money or who happened to be the smartest when they were
16. Additional benefits are that students can go to school close to home
(further reducing financial barriers to education), or can choose a school that
has programs that are interesting to them; making these choices without fear
that their future will suffer as a result.

Discrimination is discrimination; if a company is hiring someone based on their
age, race, religion, OR their Alma Mater instead of solely evaluating their
skills as objectively as possible, then it's still discrimination.
